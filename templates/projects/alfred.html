{% block body_title %}Facebook Messenger Smarthome Chatbot{% endblock %}

{% block body %}
Developed a Facebook Messenger chatbot that could control several smarthome devices with natural language. Integrated with Samsung Smartthings to control lights, camera, door/window sensors, and motion sensors. This is an on going project that began as a senior design project but I have continued to develop as I use Alfred around my home.
