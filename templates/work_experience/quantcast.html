{% block body %}
	While at Quantcast I completed a proof of concept project showing new insights about measured audiences. In the process I developed map-reduce jobs to generate data, perform statistical analysis, and validate conclusions and
	worked to increase code efficiency to handle data sets of upwards of N billion records. Additionally I created data visualization tools that drastically reduced time spent on data quality validation team-wide.
